## What can be learned from this lecture?

This course deals with the theory of computation. In other words, this course will treat the computing machines, their capabilities and limitations.

There are 2 kinds of solvable problems.

1. solvable problems **in principle**.
2. solvable problems **in practice**: that is related with NP-hardness.

This course is related with 1, which is about **the impossible problems**. When the time is resource, there are 3 types of problems. Undecidable. Intractable. Tractable. And once again, this course will treat undecidable problems.

## Is blue-screen solvable?

Blue-screen can cause huge damages to some systems, such as power plants, baking systems, cars, and so on. So this problem should be solved, and many strives had been committed to solve it. However, no one succeeded it because **this problem is unsolvable in principle**.
