Data gets bigger and bigger. From **37.4 exabytes** in  2013, to **125 exabytes** in 2017. Its growing rate is **42.5%** per year. *(in case of unstructured data)*

>  Byte --> Kilobyte --> Megabyte --> Terabyte --> Petabyte --> Exabyte --> Zettabyte --> Yottabyte

Then when these **big data** can be used?

- Manufacturing

  analysis can be used in **prognostics** or **supply planning**.

- Health care

  providing **personilzed medicine**.

- Education

  improved learning programs.

- Media & entertainment

  understanding preferences.

- Social network

  recommending, grouping (of people)

- ETC

  Finance, insurance, IoT, E-commerce, Bioinformatics

The growth of data is explosive. Then how can we treat it? By **automating the collection and availability** of data. 

Where these explosive big data comes from? It is from **business** and **science** and **society, everyone**.

What are the **defininition** of big data? [**3Vs**](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/3Vs)

1. Volume
2. Velocity
3. Variety

#### Data deluge

The quantity of information is soaring. So someone has to make the information meaningful. This process is [data deluge](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2010/02/25/the-data-deluge "The economists").

 

#### Inductive Inference

It is the most important intellectual activity of humans. We know the snowy road is slippery by experience. 

What are the factors that influence the accuracy of induction?

- amount of past data
- quality of past data

So it is important to deluge **interesting data** from soaring data. This is **Data mining**. And other names of it are advanced analytics, predictive analytics, machine learning, and pattern recognition. 

> Interesting data which is **non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown,** and **potentially useful**.
